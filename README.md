# Newspaper Classification
This repository covers all the scripts and notebooks used to build a classifier for text recognition and NLP.

The main objective of the project was to classify articles based on their headline and the subsequent 1-3 sentences in order to predict their respective ressort.

With the help of NLP, the NewsClassifier assigns journalistic texts to a department. Detached from news and journalism, the early detection and processing of information plays a vital role in the survival of institutions. The program provides an approach to this by evaluating text and then classifying it. As a result, "hot topics" should be detected automatically.
